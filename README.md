# üè† Home Assistant Telegram Bot with Apple Shortcuts Integration

This project lets you control your smart home devices through **Telegram messages**, which can be triggered manually or automatically using **Apple Shortcuts**.

It‚Äôs a lightweight bot that connects your Telegram account with Home Assistant using its REST API. Use simple text commands to control devices like:

- ‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Machine  
- üî• Heating (Upstairs & Downstairs)  
- üíß Dehumidifier  
- üõ† Any Home Assistant service (via advanced "call service" command)

# Why is this necessary?

I tried to achieve this before by just using two bots, one that would listen on my server and another one that would send the message from my phone. However, Telegram does not allow bot-to-bot communication so the messages from one bot are invisible to the other bots. However, using the telegram listernet on the server allows you to get any type of message even if it comes from a bot. 



## ‚ú® Features

- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Securely control your smart home via Telegram messages.
- **Apple Shortcuts Ready**: Trigger commands from your iPhone using buttons or Siri.
- **Temperature Customization**: Set specific temperatures (15¬∞C‚Äì24¬∞C), defaults to 19¬∞C if out of range or missing.
- **Command Logging**: Every valid command is logged with a timestamp.
- **Extensible**: Easily expand to control any Home Assistant service via `"call service"`.
